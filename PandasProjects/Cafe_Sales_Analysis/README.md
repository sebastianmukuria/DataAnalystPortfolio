# â˜• Cafe Sales Analysis

This project takes a **messy cafe sales dataset** and transforms it into a clean, business-ready dataset.  
I then run an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights about sales, revenue, and customer behavior.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in `Price Per Unit`, `Quantity`, and `Total Spent`.
- Resolved ambiguous prices (e.g., Sandwich vs Smoothie).
- Standardized item names and dropped dirty placeholders (`ERROR`, `UNKNOWN` â†’ NA).
- Ensured consistency: `Quantity * Price Per Unit = Total Spent`.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Analysis
Key business insights:
- **Top-selling items:** Coffee dominates by quantity, but high-value items like Salad bring more revenue.
- **Revenue trend:** Monthly sales show clear seasonal patterns.
- **Payment methods:** Customers prefer Digital Wallets over Cash.
- **Location analysis:** In-store generates more revenue than takeaway.
