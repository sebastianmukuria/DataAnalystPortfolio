# 📊 Sebastian Mukuria – Data Analyst Portfolio  

## 👋 About Me  
Hi, I’m Sebastian! I’ve worked as a **research analyst in the crypto industry**, where I built automation tools, wrote SQL queries, and led projects to improve data workflows in addition to blockchain research focusing on layer-1 and layer-2 networks. I also have experience as a **business data analyst in the defense sector** and co-founded a recycling startup focused on sustainability.  

I earned my **B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (UC Riverside)** and I’m now pursuing an **A.A. in Data Science**.

## 🎯 Current Focus  
- Leveling up in **Python** and **SQL**  
- Building dashboards and visualizations
- Refreshing mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science.
- Documenting my journey from analyst → data scientist → future ML engineer

## 🚀 Projects  
- 🐍 **[Python Automation Bot](https://github.com/sebastianmukuria/ReleaseSummarizerBot)** – Built Slack + LLM integration to summarize events and reduce manual workload.  
- 💾 **[SQL Tech Layoffs Analysis](https://github.com/sebastianmukuria/DataAnalystPortfolio/tree/main/SQL%20Projects/Tech%20Layoffs%20Project)** – Queried and explored layoff datasets to uncover industry trends.
- ☕️ **[Cafe Sales Analysis](https://github.com/sebastianmukuria/DataAnalystPortfolio/tree/main/PandasProjects/Cafe_Sales_Analysis)** - Data cleaning and EDA exercise on a messy cafe sales dataset. 

## 🌱 Goal  
This repo tracks my progress as I grow my skills, one project at a time. Long term, I’m aiming for **machine learning engineering**—but every dataset and script along the way gets me closer.
